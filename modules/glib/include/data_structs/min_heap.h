/*
 * Min heaps are implemented using pairing heaps, as described in the paper at
 * https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sleator/papers/pairing-heaps.pdf
 *
 *
 *
 * Elements of the heap, from the heap's point of view, only have a key value
 * (used in determining the heap invariant), a sibling/parent pointer, and a
 * left child pointer. To remove or decrease a node, a pointer to the min heap
 * node struct must be supplied by the user. On extract min/find min, a pointer
 * to the min heap node is returned, and it is up to the user to translate this
 * back to whatever structure contains this node
 *
 * The easiest way to accomplish this is by inlining the heap node struct in
 * whatever structure is to be stored in the heap
 *
